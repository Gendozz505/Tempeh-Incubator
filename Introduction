One day I got an offer to make a business. My partner told me about tempeh, traditional Indonesian soy product, that is made from fermented soybeans. I'm a vegetarian and a healthy food lover, so I gladly agreed to take a part in this adventure. My part was to check the market, talk to vegetarian restaurants, shops and products distributors. Besides I was studding electrical engineering in university, so I got some experience with CPU and coding, and when we reached the point of our first trial tempeh production I offered him to make an incubator for fermentation. So this is the short story of its rising. Hope you will love it.
